# school district analysis
## Overview of the school district analysis: 
The purpose of the analysis is to replace the math and reading scores from Thomas High School with NaN's while keeping the rest of the data intact. Once the scores have been replaced the school district analysis needs to be repeated and a written report with the findings has been requested.

## Results: Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions.

- How is the district summary affected?
  - Removing the Nan values only slightly affected the overall district numbers 
- How is the school summary affected?
- How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
- How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
- Math and reading scores by grade
- Scores by school spending
- Scores by school size
- Scores by school type

## Summary: 
- Summarize four changes in the updated school district analysis after reading and math scores for the ninth grade at Thomas High School have been replaced with NaNs.
